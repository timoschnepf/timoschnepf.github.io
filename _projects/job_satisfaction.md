Baccaro and Pontusson argue that the wage share in Germany did not rise in the last two
decades because of Germany’s dependency on exports (export-led growth model). 
They argue that strong price sensitivity of German exports in manufacturing allowed companies
to restrain wages.

Baccaro and Pontusson argue that the wage share in Germany did not rise in the last two
decades because of Germany’s dependency on exports (export-led growth model). 
They argue that strong price sensitivity of German exports in manufacturing allowed companies
to restrain wages. Labour unions in Germany even supported these wage restrains in favour of
risking job cuts. Furthermore, a rising wage share may induce rising domestic prices which 
upgrades the domestic currency. Thus, rising wages would hamper the German economy twofold:
i) by increasing production costs due to higher labour costs and ii) by stressing foreign demand
due to a currency appreciation: 

<blockquote>
"To the extent that exports are price-sensitive, growing exports
requires repression of wages and consumption to prevent an appreciation of the real effective 
exchange rate" (Baccaro and Pontusson, 2016, p. 189; see also Behringer et al., 2016, p. 9).
