  abstract={The attractiveness of job ads positively influences job pursuit intentions of job seekers. With regards
to an expected increasing labour shortage in the Green Economy, the question arises how attractively
green apprenticeship job ads are promoted. Therefore, this exploratory study examines how strong job
advertisement texts refer to environmental sustainability (ES). Based on 1.1 million German job ads for
apprenticeships from 2011 to 2019 and a newly developed wordlist with 1,799 ES related expressions,
we identify which advertisements refer to ES and with which strength they do so. Concerning strong
signal words, we find a positive trend among those job ads that already contain ES related words such
as “solar system” or “electro mobility”.},
