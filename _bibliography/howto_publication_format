There are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:

    abbr: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.
    abstract: Adds an "Abs" button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text
    arxiv: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
    bibtex_show: Adds a "Bib" button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry
    html: Inserts an "HTML" button redirecting to the user-specified link
    pdf: Adds a "PDF" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
    supp: Adds a "Supp" button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
    blog: Adds a "Blog" button redirecting to the specified link
    code: Adds a "Code" button redirecting to the specified link
    poster: Adds a "Poster" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
    slides: Adds a "Slides" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
    website: Adds a "Website" button redirecting to the specified link
    altmetric: Adds an Altmetric badge (Note: if DOI is provided just use true, otherwise only add the altmetric identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
    dimensions: Adds a Dimensions badge (Note: if DOI or PMID is provided just use true, otherwise only add the Dimensions' identifier here - the link is generated automatically)

You can implement your own buttons by editing the bib.html file.
