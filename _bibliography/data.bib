  abstract={The WAoeN is a german word list consisting of 1800 keywords (single-word and multi-word expressions) associated with 
  environmental sustainability. Each term was assigned a semi-metric scale value between one and five. 
  This operationalises the degree of association with the theoretical construct "ecological sustainability". 
  The word list is based on a publicly available word list from the Federal Environment Agency (UBA/BMU 2021). 
  It was enriched with the help of a Word2Vec model and GermaNet.}
