Hello! My name ist Timo and I work as a **research associate** at the Federal Institute for Vocational Education 
and Training ([BIBB](https://www.bibb.de/)) in Bonn, Germany.
I graduated with a Master of Science in Sociology and Social Research at the University Cologne.

I'm an applied social scientist interested in **quantitative data analysis**, causal inference, data visualisation and 
**computational methods**. 
I'm particularly interested in **occupational inequality** and how people perceive it.

At BIBB, I'm currently leading the development of a new data portal called the [Occupations and Skills Radar](https://www.bibb.de/de/170512.php).
The BMBF-funded project aims to provide an unified database and research tool for the user-friendly study of occupations and skills.
